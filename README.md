# Low Level Programming

####This repository consists of all the C programming projects done at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [Walton Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walton-lee-443560a6)
####All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce the output that they are looking for. Edge cases are also taken into consideration.
####In the table below, you will find the project name and a short description about the topic.

##**Major Projects:**

|                  Project Name               |                     Description                     |
| :-----------------------------------------: |  :-----------------------------------------------:  |
|        0x00-hello_world                     |  **Goal:** Introduction to the multiple phases of compilation, printf and puts functions, data types, and how much memory each data type occupies in bytes.|
|        0x01-variables_if_else_while         |  **Goal:** Learning what and how to: use conditional statements, (if, else),loops, commenting code, declaring variables of different types, using relational and logical operators, understanding ASCII, and mainly using putchar to print to standard out properly.  |
|        0x02-functions_nested_loops          |  **Goal:** Learning how to use a nested loop, what the difference between a declaration and definition of a function, what a function prototype is, what the scope of a variable is, and what a header file is.  |
|        0x03-more_functions_nested_loops     |  **Goal:** Additional practice with nested loops, prototypes, conditional statements, scope of a variable, and creating a header file. |
|        0x04-pointers_arrays_strings         |  **Goal:** Introduction of what, how to use, and manipulating pointers, arrays, and strings.  |
|        0x05-pointers_arrays_strings         |  **Goal:** More practice with the idea of using and manipulating pointers, arrays, and strings.  |
|        0x06-pointers_arrays_strings         |  **Goal:** Even more practice with the idea of using and manipulating pointers, arrays, and strings.  |
|        0x07-recursion                       |  **Goal:** Introduction to what recursion is and how to use it.  |
|        0x08-static_libraries                |  **Goal:** Introduction to what a static library is and how to create one.  |
|        0x09-argc_argv                       |  **Goal:** Learning and using arguments that are passed to main.  |
|        0x0A-malloc_free                     |  **Goal:** Learning about manual memory allocation using malloc and freeing that space once done using it.  |
|        0x0B-more_malloc_free                |  **Goal:** More practice with the idea of manual memory allocation and freeing that space.  |
|        0x0C-preprocessor                    |  **Goal:** Introduction of when and how to use macros. Introduction to "include guard" header files.  |
|        0x0D-structures_typedef              |  **Goal:** Introduction of when, what, why, and how to use structures and typedef.  |
|        0x0E-function_pointers               |  **Goal:** Introduction to how and when to use function pointers and what a funciton pointer holds.  |
|        0x0F-variadic_functions              |  **Goal:** Introduction to Variadic Functions and using va_start, va_arg, and va_end macros.  |
|        0x11-singly_linked_lists             |  **Goal:** Introduction to the idea of data structures via singly linked lists. |
|        0x12-more_singly_linked_lists        |  **Goal:** Additional practice with linked lists as well as malloc and free.  |
|        0x13-bit_manipulation                |  **Goal:** Introduction to bit manipulation by using bitwise operators.   |
|        0x14-file_io                         |  **Goal:** Introduction to file descriptors and using read, write, open, and close functions.  |
